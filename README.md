# TECHNO STUDY Agile Software Testing Project - 2  
### DemoWebShop TR Sprint  
**Sprint Duration:** 1 week  

### Test Environment:  
- **URL:** [DemoWebShop Project](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/)

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to create and manage an automation test project, incorporating the provided user stories. The project includes team collaboration, code management, and testing processes.

### Step 1: Creating User Stories and Task Assignments  
- Understand the provided user stories and create tasks for each story.  
- Open the tasks in **Jira** and discuss them during sprint meetings.  
- Prioritize the tasks in sprint meetings (Refinement / Sprint Planning) and assign story points.  
- Create a sprint backlog based on the number of team members and the tasks to be completed.  

### Step 2: Writing Test Scenarios  
- Write test scenarios using **Jira Xray** or **Zephyr** plugin.  
- Each scenario should include:
  - Scenario name
  - Description
  - Steps
  - Expected results  
- Refine the test scenarios during daily standup meetings.

### Step 3: Code Development and Test Execution  
- Set up a **GitHub repository** for the test code.  
- The Team Lead will create the **master branch** and set up **branch protection rules**.  
- Team members clone the master branch locally, create a new branch under their own name, and develop test code in their branch to avoid conflicts.  
- We will use an already developed web environment for testing:
  - [DemoWebShop](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/).

### Step 4: Code Review and Merge Process  
- Each team member initiates a pull request to merge their changes into the master branch.  
- The Team Lead reviews the pull requests and may ask for corrections if necessary.  
- Code review is performed on each pull request, and once approved, the changes are merged into the master branch by the Team Lead.  
- Before any coding begins, each member should:
  1. Check the remote **GitHub repository** for the latest updates.
  2. Update their local master branch.
  3. Merge the updated master into their own branch to avoid conflicts.  
  **Note:** This step is **critical** to avoid an increase in conflicts.  

### Step 5: Post-Sprint Evaluation and Transfers  
- Conduct a **sprint retrospective** to assess what went well and what can be improved.  
- Optionally, complex or incomplete user stories can be transferred to the next sprint.  
- Share the GitHub repository link and Jira board screenshots in communication channels like **Discord**.  
- Tag mentors and teachers when sharing updates.

### Support and Mentorship  
- Team members can request help from the Team Lead or use communication channels for assistance.  
- If needed, create "Knowledge Transfer" (KT) requests via Discord or other platforms and tag team members and mentors for help. Mentors will provide guidance and share knowledge.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
- **JDK Version:** [Specify JDK version used]  
- **Selenium Version:** [Specify Selenium version used]  
- **Testing Framework:** [Include any testing framework like TestNG, JUnit]  
- **Action Class:** The project requires the use of the **Action** class in Selenium for simulating complex user interactions.  
- **Version Control:** **GitHub** for code management  
- **Project Management:** **Jira** with Zephyr plugins for test case management.

## Project Information  
This project offers opportunities to improve team collaboration, apply code management practices, test processes, and enhance communication skills. Additionally, it provides hands-on experience with real-world tools and methods used in software testing.
